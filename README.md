This is a fork of the [Skeletyl](https://github.com/HID-Technologies/Skeleton-Dactyl-Mini) originally designed by HID-Technologies (further developed by BastardKB into [Skeletyl V2](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Skeletyl)).

# Wiring
For re-using dactyl manuform firmware this wiring should be backwards compatible, with some minor difference to the thumb cluster.
